in spito 11 her terror: perhaps in the last v. there was something to
which this refers, such es ‘matrem ille labantem': Olaud. ib.9 ‘Nonne
uides ut saeue senex incendia monstret, Vt trepido genetrix inuocet ore
deosi Erexit formido comam perque omne metallum Fusus in attonito
palluit aere tremor’: or else we must read ‘Tutus uterque pio sub
pondere suffieit illo'. 640 comp. Conon, etc. cited above, and Pausan.

111114 ‘Illum et securi circumspexere fragorem Elysii’3 x 88 ‘Seou-

‘secretosque pios, his dantem iura Catonem’, and read Semelae.

As I promised in the introduction, I append some remarks on
Professor Haupt's program 11 1854: p. 3 hethas emends 51 foll:
Inpius et miles metuentia comminus astra Prouocat, admotis ad territa
sidera signis Prouocat infestus cunctos ad proelia diuos. Iuppiter e
coelo metuit dextramque corusca Armatus flamma oet: ad amieo is,
he says, a correction of Eueruinus Wassenberghius: the transposition of
52 and 53 is his own. 1 eaelo metuit he defends by Proper-t. v 659
⁴ peter Idalio miratur caesar ab astro’: to me the context seems to
require caelo metuit: I prefer too the coemeram of all mss P. 4 in 60
he reads od 111· im: but with 111 bellmsdmn may we not compare such

’ expressions as Ovid her. 15197 ‘ N on mihi respondent ueteres in carmina

uircs’, Aen. vn 664 ‘Pila manu saeuosque gerunt in bella dolones’‚ and
‘in utrumque paratus'l 62 he reads laeuus 111 saeuus: I prefer 1111111113
but both corrections 1111111 occurred to me, and would occur to any
scholar: in the same v. he proposes* utrimque secus for animone deus.
Iu 68 he adopts the reading 11 a l6th century edition, Amplexa est
11111111· Impelleras uictos: but that is surely rewritiug‚ not correcting:
que too seems in that case a most inadequate connecting particle. I
do not see that it is more absurd to picture Parth carried along in
the rout of her children, as she attempts to rally them, than to
represent the stars as fighting 1111111 side of heaven. P. 111119 he
proposes Ambustum oar or Ambustum 1111 111 I apositam et. P. 6 in 73
he prefers patulis 11 Aldus. 761111161111111111 reram. 77 111911
uiderunt 19111111 111 miyros uidermet ommino. P. 7 in 80 111 proposes ἱ
strauere 11111111 111 poeno strauere: 81 ponto for poema: I could un·
derstand ‘sollicitant pomis sollicitantque aquis’ or ‘sollicitant fame
