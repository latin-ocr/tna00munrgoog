malac=credit aliquis: this use of the and pers sing. potentialis ex-
tremely frequent in Latin: comp. Madvig 31011 310, and my n. to
Luor. 1327possic=possumus or potest aliquis, and 1141 (lam uideas:
uidemus or uidet aliquis: Madvig observes that this idiom is 01 very ex-

tensive use, employed alikc in the chief clauses 01 sentences, or, as
here, aster conjunctions, aa', eam, etc, 01 relatives: the imperf. is so used
as well as the present: Lucr. v 1332 and v11268 ualerem and posses
more than once: with this union of cst and credas comp. Lucr. 11850
‘Quoad licet ac possis’, where lachmann’s 1011000 is no more necessary
than Jacob's eredis here: the same idiom occurs below, 401 ‘si forte
manu teneas ac...cernas,...putes', where Jacob quite spoils the passage
by violent and useless changes: teneas and ceratas do not depend on ei
sorte, hut: tenemus, cernimus. 303 Proraere seems quite necessary:
the caverna tumble in; and the air thufflisplaced rushes about and
raises wind: 1010111545 ί11011101 ubi ingentis speluncas subruit aetas:
Quippe cadunt toti montes’: this use 01 prorraere appears in the silver
age: Tae. 01111122 ‘motu terrae...oppidnm Pompei magna ex parte
proruit’. 310 macore 01 a allays 01 once ‘certamina tanta’ 01 editors,
Scaliger, Gorallus, Wernsdorf, J acob. 311 effundere, animas or auras:
it is carious how he has dwelt and continues 10 dwell on this productiori
of air and wind from moisture. But in ahot climate the difference in
temperatura between the 011 and running waters often makes the
currente 01 011 very perceptible. 314 Flam. ponae seem to b'e the
riaa' taken from the cannia and distributed 101 irrigation over the fields:
Pliny 111 119 ‘[Padus] deductus in flumina et fossas inter Rauennam
Altinumque': Flaccina appears to corne from 0 misunderstanding 01 the
passage. aaa i. a harum aurarum, ‘currente 01011 from water'.

315 ‘humor adspirat fortes auras, et uerberibus impellit ', thus increasing
their force: Aen. v607 ‘uentosque adspirat eunti’: but our passage is
very obscurely expresseri, if the mss are right. 313 a'a 00000, ‘in the
open air'. reram is a fine correction of J acob’s: Lucretius uses it several
times 101 water or molatura generally: see my note 101496. 317
claci: thisform‚ to judge from the hest mss, 01 Juvenal 101 instance
and Seneca, was common in the silver age. 318 penitas, “within the
earth,’ is opposed to aetra: the word often occurs with this sense in our
poem: ecasae is nomin. 10 decapitant: the same causes act on the winds
below; and being there pent up, these work with more fury: the notion
he aga-in and again so elaborately insiste on. 320 suffocat, the passage
chokes the winds as they are thus fighting, and compels them to burst
out. 323 adatr. cart. is much the same as Pugnantia suffocat. tcap.
icta is illustrated by ‘primos ultimus urget’: one spiritua strikes on
another, and so impels it onwards, as one wavc another ware. ³24

· 325 airas of one v. has come from airas 01 the other: a common error
