to such an instrument as Olaudins' Triton on lake Fucinus which gave

whether it be that very Triton, it is impossible to say, as we know that
similar playthings existed long before from Heron, who in his pneumatica
p. 171 describes a σάλπιγξ thus blown by water, and p. 221 oue blown
by steam bya ζωὸἆριον ἐσχηματισμένον εἷς Τρίτωνα. ueluti is answered

divide the horae: Lucan 11 689 ‘neu bucina diuidat horas’: 1010 may

hora: daci may mean the emperor, 0111111111 01 another 3 or any com-

is worked by a body 01 water and by the air constrained thereby to set
it in motion: just as the water of the clouds impels the wiuds which put
Etna in motion. collectus aquae occurs in Lucr.1v414 and in Fron-
tinus 296 another machine, worked in like manner hy water setting

Virgil and some of the most carefnl pcets avoid this3 though the best
prose writers employ it freely. Car. 111. must mean a tune produced by
the pressure of water. cortina is the hydraulis or waterorgan: why it
’ is so called I do not know, whether from its shape resembling somehow
a pot, or else the sacred 1101 and tripod 011 which the Pythia sat ; or, as
Wernsdorf poet. min. 11 p. 398 suggests, from the lond noise which came
forth from the Delphic 00111110 causing the name to be transferred to
this unusual lond-sounding instrument But as the word occurs only '
here in this sense, the meaning is uncertain: the box containing the

which we might infer that cortica denotes the shape. Heron, who
describes elaborately a hydraulis urgan just after the Triton mentioned
above, calls the copper chest containing the water more than once a
βωμίσκοςε but his drawing gives it the shape of a square altar. San. nat
