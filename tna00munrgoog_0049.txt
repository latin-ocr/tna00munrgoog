for instance that in Propert. 111 (11) 34 53 we should read ‘N ec si poet
Stygiae aliquid rest (i. e. re eet) arbiter undas': comp. ‘Sunt aliquid
menes’ and the like. Probably in many cases where our msa now give
eet in full, our author wrote et, ee in 19 instenoes in which cet now
occurs at the end of α verse 3 es well ae in no lese than 38 instancee
where a vowel or an m is elided before eet by our mes in other perte ot
the werse. If the poet did' not always write the enclitic et, he probably
meent ue eo to pronounce, es in most of these cases an elision would not be
admissible according to hie principles “ of versification which are mostly
Ovidien, the prevailing feshiou iu his ege. Thus while que or other
instances of ἕ are freely elided, more than-100 times 3 he ie much more-
chery in eliding d or a syllable ending in m, and in the whole poem
there are hardly more than 20 cases oi the elision oi e long vowel 3 and
in these laet es well as those of d end m e wery large proportion of the
elisione occur between the first and ind foot or in the middle of the ltu,

harsh than elsewhere In other ceses the elision was designed to pro-
duce eome particular effect probor: Mart. ιν 44 5 ‘Haec Veneris sedes
Lacedaemone gratior illi'.

Hyla is the same thing artheula of u, the aspirato then aud long

baec, on the other cohercet, chalcitide, Ιιοο for οο : see Ribbeek's proleg. to
Virgil p. 422 423, 421, 452 and the authorities he cites: e writes
throughout οοιΙυιο and aethnaeae. For Hyla compare Stephanus Byr.
