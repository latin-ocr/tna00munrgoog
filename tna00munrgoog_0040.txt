at, nand 5, a aud 5 515 among the letters most commonly interchanged
evidently from these letters respectively being not easy to distinguish in
some archetype· of the inferior 11155 as well as a: by thia confusion of 5
with c and 5 1 explain for instance in 6 Dodona for Lodooo'a and in 522
portura for porcam.

The immense superiority of a over all the later 11155. is seen through·
out the poem: in 50 places it makes sense of what in themis quite
unintelligible; and in many other places points out the right road tc
emendation 3 while it is only in a few trivial 51 occidental cases where
they have any advantage over o, asin 19 where the copyist for matrem
reads 1115111551,1115 dealem of 20 having caught his eye. Thus a alone

progenitor, removed from them not many degrees. This will be still
plainer when I have described the fragment I call β.

Τ115 history of this fragment which has long disappeared 15 very
obscure and uncertain: itis not always easy to determine what its read·

in two different repertorieS, one meant 15 115 supplementary tc the other.
The older 51 these is Walchius' Acta societ. Ienensis vol. v 1511756,
pp. 3-6,a very imperfect collation: the second is found in the Neue
Bibliothek der schoenen Wissenschaften 151591111311-327, where
F. 0. Matthiae supplies what was omitted in the other place from a
fuller collation sent to him by KulenkampJand taken from the margin
