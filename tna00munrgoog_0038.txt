whether he has 001 now proved his point, the only point he has proved
being that he does not understand what he is talking about But what
I have said by no means applies to all the notes 3 nor can any oue
disputa that he has often rightly emended the corrupt text: he has
employed too much more judiciously than Werusdorf the Florentino
fragment .

And now Ι come to the manuscripts which I have 01010000 01 r as
already said, this poem should never have been edited byme,ii1 had
not met with the manuscript in our public 'library, Kkv 34, numbered
2076 in the new catalogue. This codex is 00 much superior to all other
existing codicesboth in age and in merit, that not only have I groundcd
my text mainly on it, but as in duty bound have noted the minutest
discrepancies of spelling: Icall it c. Besides 01 have cellalad, and so
far as I know have been the first to collate, two manuscripts in the
British Museum: one which'I call γ forms part 01 Arundel 133, a large
folio iu double columns: the Aetna begins at leaf 921) and ends at 96 b:
the lst column has 38 11000 besides the heading, 110 last page¹ contains
141000, all the other columns have 39 lines each. This codex is of the
15thcentu1y, but belongs to the less interpolated class 01 late mss. and
is extremely like, though I think on the whole rather better than
J acob’s ms. 3, which Ι (100010 by a: my critical notes will shew fully

their relation to each other. The second codex which I name t, is
Sloane 777, art. 6, written on vellum in a small Italian hand late in 110
1511 century. It belongs to the more interpolatcd class of mss and
ascribes the poem to Cornelius Severus, which γ gives to Virgil: it'
departs however 1000 from c and the better mss. than Scaliger's worth-
less codex aud the early printed copies do. To these mss. Ι have joined
J acob's two, his H which I call 1, and his 3 which Ι call c 8 was col-
lated for him by Lachmann 3 aud therefore, we may feel sure, with
accuracy. Though it is dated 00 1010 001470, tis the best of the infe·
normes, better 00 110 whole I think than γ and ι, much better than ζ,
or the early editions, though, compared with o, it is 10 be reckoned
merely among these. sis assigned to 1101411 centmy by one Kmntn
1ο 110 end 01110 l3th by one Wachler‚ as Ι learn from Hand, Stat silv.
p. xxv: according to Hand it is the best extant ms. ior 'Statius' silvae 3
but it must I think belong really to the 1511 century. The variatione
01 virt Ι have not given 01 course with the same minuteness as theseos
a: it would have been mere waste of space, and worse, 1ο have done 00.
Ι1 ie perhaps only the shortness 01 the poem that excuses my citing even
so much from them: usually, where they agree entirely or essentially
with one another, I denote them by c, as I shall explain below. Before
¹ Icome 1ο 110 1001 Florentino fragment which Icall β, I must describe 0
more fully: the different pieces which the manuscript contains cre
