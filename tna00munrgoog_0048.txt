of the program I have devoted a separate appendix. The learned und
aooomplished critic has had the ill-luok to got a most imecnrate collation
of a. .

The manuscripts which I denote by a, β, γ, t, ι, tmpeccively have
been fully described above: as I have already said, the minutest rania
tions of c hare been recorded 3 as well ss tho readings of the lost frag-
ment β, so lar as a comparison of the two authorities on 'which I had to
