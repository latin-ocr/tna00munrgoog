page was written ‘In Aetna V. signifieat cod. Florentinum, quem inde
habuit Ernstius nempe solum partem illem’. Matthiae thinks the
collation is not Ernstius', but N. Heinsius’, as Burmann, n. to Ovid
met. 1 85, gives two of its readings with these words ‘sed legendum ex
antiquo codice Mediceo quem Heinsius contulit’. One Hem. Ernstius
publishcd in 1641 a very brief catalogue of the Laurentian library: in it

Virgil which Bandini describes: Lucoa would seem to be the place
where it really existed. Ι bave taken great paine 10 get from these two
sources as complete a collation as Ι could 01 this fragment of 15011nes:
