admirabilis suit3 siquidem mater eins Laudice, cum nupta esset Antio-
cho olaro inter Philippi duces uiro, uisa sibi est per quietem ex concu-
bitu Apollinis concepisse grauidamque factam cet. Ubi post mortem
Alexandri occupato regno orientis urbem condidit, ibi quoque geminae
originis memoriam consecrauit. nam et urbem ex Antiochi patris
nomine Antiochiam uocauit et campos uicinos Apollini dicauit '. Seleu-
cus in 300 no. founded at the same time Antioch, which chrysostom a
native proudly terma the κεφαλὴ καὶ μήτηρ of all the cities of the east,
and at live miles distance, higher up the Orontes, the parlr and sanctuary
of Daphne which Ohrysostom, Ammian and others so olten call a suburb
os Antioch. Daphne was no less famous than Antioch, which on coins,
in inscriptions and books is as often called Antiocb by Daphne, Antiocb
os Daphne, as Daphne is termed Daphne by Antioeh: καὶ πάντα ἦν ἤ
Δάφνη Σελεύκῳ, says Libanius in his Antiochicus Chrysostom‚ while
invidiously annasting the earthly Daphne with the heavenly J cruia
lem, cannot conceal what charms it had for the children of this world
Το Antiocb and Daphne was transplanted the whole worship of Apollo:
unable to create, the Syrien Greeks brought hither the very names
os old Hellas, Omtalia and the like: an omphalos, far larger than that os
Delphi, was set up by Antiochia Epiphanes or Epimenes in the middle
teu-astylon of his great οοαοεοΙ, street· of colonnades. Ausonius, declar.
urb, 3, says ‘Phoebeae lauri domus Antioohia'

, But on the banks of the Orontes· Daphne was always called daughter
¹ of ladon: nay the very river was transferred to Syria, lilre canta
Whyl was Laodice connected with the Peloponnese and the parts of it
where the Ladon flowedl Much else was brought from thence to Syria
On the hill Silpion was an old Syrian Ione, on which Seleucus Nicator
sacrifioed to Zeus Ceraunios in the spring of 30⁶), before founding
Antiocb This gave rise to the notion of an ArgiveAthenian colony
sent to recover Io, and to other tastaless perversione of the genuine my-
thology. Ladon isa fine river, but not better than twenty others in the
‘great Dorian island of Pelops’3 and in the unperverted- legend was
known as father os Metope fomous in the mythical history of Thebes
and Hellas: see Pindarolymp. νῙ aud his scholiast, and Diodorusrvta
Even in Ovid and Hyginus we know Daphne only as daughter of
Peneus. But Antiocb changed all this: Pausanias v111 201 thus writes:
ὅδὲ Λάδων ποταμῶν τῶν ἐν Ἑλλάδι ὕδωρ παρέχεται κάλλιστον, ἔχει di καὶ
άλλως ἐς ἀνθρώπους φήμην καὶ τά ᾀδόμενα is niv Δάφνην. τοῦλόγου di
rosi ἐς Δάφνην rol μὲν Συρίοις τοῖς οἰκοῦσιν ἐπὶ Ὀρόντῃ ποταμῷ παρίημι
κ.τ.λ What was told by the Syrians on the Orontesl Philostratus in
, bis life of Apollonius1 16 p. 19 will throw some light on this: ἐπεφοάτησε
καὶ Ἀντιοχείᾳ τῇ μεγάλη πεπαυμένος τοῦ ommis, καὶ παρῆλθεν ἐς rei ‘opto
τοῦ Δαφναίου Ἀπόλλωνος, ᾧ περιάπτουσιν Ἀσσύριοι riv μῦθον τὸν Ἀρκάδα·
