favour-ite, notwithstanding a protest from Markland, inclined e‘ven to
underrate the merit and age of the poem, who declared with reason that
there was no resemblance between its style and that of the undoubted
remeius of Severus. In truth the longest fragment, that of 25 verses on
the death of Cicero preserved by the elder Seneca, has an Ovidian
fulness and eleaticity and easy fiow which we look for in vain iu any
part of our· poem. His friend Ovid addresses hin as tue ‘uates mag·
norum maxime regum‘ 3 and Quintilian, 1189, says that, though he
isa better versifier than poet, yet if the whole cf his ‘ bellum Siculum '
had been written like the first book, he would have justdy claimed
the second place among Roman heroic poete, above ovid himself.
Tharais no doubt that the Italian scholar who first assigned the poem
to Severus, was led to do so solely through a passage iu the ’19111
epistle of Seneca, where heis speaking of his friend Lucilius’ intention
1ο describe Etna in his poem, ‘ hunc sollemnem omnibus poetis locum’:
‘quem quominus Ouidius tractaret nihil obstitit qnod iam Vergilius
impleuerat: ne Seuerum quidem Cornelium uterque detorruit'. But
the natural meaning of Seneca's words, as Wernsdorf hes seen, iethet
1 Severus had inserted in his ‘bellum Siculum’ a short episode about
i Etnr, as Virgil bad done in his Aeneid and Ovid in his metamorphoses.
ἵ This passage therefore is by no means in fivcurof his clalms, as our
poem forms a distinct and complete whole. These rery words ol
Seneca however led Wernsdorf, and have since induced Jacob and
many others to maintain unhesitatingly that Iarcilius himself is the
author: with what truth we have next to examine For the sole
l purpose of throwing some light cn this question Ihave read through the
, whole of Seneca's letters The results obtained Ihad intended at first
to state at some length3 but I lrave since come to the conclusion that .
the matter is not important enough for this 3 arrd I have accordingly
compressed what I have to say into as brief a space as possible.
In his filet epistle Seneca says ‘quod Epicurus amico suo potuit
promittere, hoc tibi promitto, Lucili: habebo apud posteros gratiam,
· possmn mecum duratura nomina educere’ 3 and be has lrept his werd:
but for Seneea's writings the name of Lucilius would have been unknown
l to un As it is, we see hina in a great variety of aspecta 3 fer to him are
1 addressed the whole of Seneca's letters, the first book of the dialogum,
and the seven books of naturales quaestiones, in all much more than
balfhis extant works From these various sources we learn much about
Lucilius: his cognomen was Iunior, he was procuratores Sicily during
the whole time that Seneca corresponded with him 3 of humble birth he
bad raised himself to this place by his own merite: ‘in medium te pro
Ξ tulit ingenii vigor, scriptorum elegantia, clarae et nobiles amicitiae’.
He had seen much service, had crosaed the Great and Little St Bernard
