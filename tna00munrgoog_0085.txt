521 robora 115151511115 word: with its real substance 1115511 my slight
corrections and my punctuation 11515 seem to give the sense required.

522 1711531151 read 151 Vltroque, a slight and Ι think necessary change: ⁴

‘in both oases’ ie. both 1115511 5111 solid: it answers 151115 ‘seu forte
⁵ madentes oet.’ 51 1115 next 111 the word is thrioe used by Lucretius 11 1115
same way, 11 86, 291, 115171 Vtramque 51 γε ς· and editions has no
· meaning. 523 terretis not neut as Scaliger says: ‘tenet conseruntque
notas' are joined. 526-528 Ι 115 151 profess to explain: color ipsc
seems to refer to the same fact as 427 ‘certissima signa coloris’: colouris
the 31551 test 51 1115 1115 molaris: I should therefore have put the sign 515
155115, if Ι could have explained the rest satisfirctorily, as 55155551 can
hardly agree with 551551. 523 too seems to me to point to a lacuna
5111515261 Ι dou’t deny, he says, 111515511511 other stones do burn
fieroely3 but they cannot be 1115511 1115 1515 like the 15515115. 530
propriu 511155 :proprietas of 513. 532 fcidr'cos a: a Greek word 15
wanted with something like 1115 55155 51 findis: Scaliger therefore oon·
jectures chycce or rhytas: 11 5115155151, as it probably is, 11151 the other
mss. to what we want, the fr may come from the preceding 515 3 aud
idicos may represent hydicca or some such provincial word. 533 illa,
5515 535 commune: metaph. 11511 matching two things against each
other: ‘nor will those stoues have been properly matohed against the
structure of the molaris 11 their inner substanoe'.

535-5341 1115 1115113 51 this 5151515511 not 515115 surprise: the
hardest metals melt iu the lire 3 and you may test the 111111 yourself:
expose the stone to a moderate 1115 111 the open air: it will resist: put it
in a hot closed 11111555, and it will melt: think now how much greater
the beatis 15 which it is exposed when pent up within 1115 1111115555 51
Etua 538 Ι adopt 1155113515 ab iqui 151 pipat, aud qao 151 quac3
though perhaps there is a lacuna such as this: ‘nihil insuperabile gigni
[Ignibus et contra procrescere rursus ab igni] omnia quae cet': Hera-
clitus 1153. 41 1151115151. πυρὰς α’νταμείβεται πάντα καὶ πῦρ ἁπάντων eet:
an epicureus could not have spoken, as 5111 author here speaks, 51 Η515-
clitus, nor have grouuded his own reasoning on 5 principle 51 his,
540 we 11515 5 similar question, and answer appended without any oon-
necting particle in 599 ‘Haeo uisenda eet’: no change is needed: ‘but
after all is this so very strengel why, the hardest bodies etc': 5151. 5111.
with a question = non nimis mirum. 542 comp. Luor. 1 493 ‘Tum

glacies aeris flamma deuicta liquescit' 3 151 this passage is 51 imitation,
perhaps unoonsoious‚ of this part of Lueretius 3 for the form 51 expres-
sion comp. Luor. v 306 1511. anicios: 5ο 405 ‘extorquere animos' of his
stone: it= robur. 543 lautitias seems to occur here only: even unct
tia isos the silver ege, katitudo being the older form: here it means
‘coughness'z so 155155 1555111 51 arpentum, 155115, and the like: 51555·
