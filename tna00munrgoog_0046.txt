as though it never had been. The third passage 1115371111. where the ³

quent imitatione of the language of Lucretius no more shew him to be

Lucilius appears to have been a man of literary and philosophical
testes, given to much and multifarious readingrepist. 2 2 ‘illud autem
uide ne ista lectio auctorum multorum et omnis generis uoluminum
habeat aliquid uagum et instabile': without ae yet a fixed creed‚ but
anxious tc have one 3 ready tc be convinced hythe arguments of Seneca,
and accepting much of what he lays down, but still, as we· can see from
the very last of Seneca's letters, refusing 1ο accept some of the most ex-
treme stoical paradoxes. That during any period of their correspond-
enoe Lucilius wasa professed epicuream, Ido not believe: even in the
earliest letters Seneca often speaks of Epicurus and his sect, as he could
hardly have done to an intimate friend who was at the same time a
decided epicurean. Yet from several indicatione it would appear that
Lucilius was favourably inclined to thie school: once, epist. 23 9, Seneca
anites ‘vocem tibi Epicuri tui reddere': compare the ‘Ouidius turis’
already spoken cf : in the 107111 epistle we have ²Epicurus noster’: the
esth epietle techas more than one expression, indicating some relation
between Lucilius and Epicurus. But all this is very far from showing
that Lucilius was a professed believes· in Epicurus 3 and indeed from first
to last Seneca writes in a way that seems to me to contradict such a
supposition: no epicurean could have held the doctrines about provi-

, dence, the gods etc which Seneca attributes to his friend even at the

beginning 11 their correspondence. It seems clear enough then that
Lucilius was, like many of bis countrymen, 1111111111, witha distaste
for the ircn consistency of the Greek speculative epirit; finding much
to approve and something to dislike in each of the rival schools of Epi-
curus and the Porch, then the most popular systema in Reme. Seneca
himself shrunk from some of the extremest stoical paradoxas and owed
much 1ο the more human and humane teaching of Epicurus We leam
from Gellius that there were at least two more books of Seneca's letters
tc Lucilius ; but at the end of the twenty extant Lucilius is still a
doubter of the truths o‘f stoicism. However it is possible enough that
further reflexion and the subsequent death of Seneca may have produced
full conviction 11 the genereus spirit cf Lucilius. If then there was
