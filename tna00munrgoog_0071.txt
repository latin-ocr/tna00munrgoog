Ηο1001.1. and in the curicus poem 01 Ρ1111111. Optatianus ap. Wernsdorf
poet. minnp. 405 where 1110 arrangement and length of the vsa sug-
gests to the eye the arrangement of the tubes: 41 ‘Perque modos gra·
dibus surget secunda 000011οΑ010 cauo 01 101011, calamis crescentibus
aucta Quis bene suppositis quadratis ordine plectris Artificis manus in
numeros clauditque aperitque Spiramcnta’ will illustrate 0111 v., and
what follows ‘Sub quibus unda latens properantibus incita uentis, Quae
uicibus crebris iuuenum labor cet’, looks like 298, where 01101. undu
seems a reminiscence 01 11001327100010013011111111οἐ but the ‘arte
regentis Quae tenuem cet’ must refer to the organist who is playing on
the heys and thus driving the air into the tubes so as to produce the
music: it would seem here simply 10 10000 ‘he rows along, i. 0. plays on
the different heys, ‘by 1110011001 the water', which supplies the pressure
by which the air 10 1010011 1010 the tubes3 101 011 seem agreed that this
was the sole purpose of the water: Heron p. 229 τὰ δὲ ἐν τῷ βωμίσκῳ ὕδωρ
ἐμβάλλεται ἕνεκα τοῦ τᾶν περισσευόνταλᾶἔρα ἓν τῷ πνιγεῖ, λέγω δὴ τᾶν ἔκ τῆς
πυξίδας ὥθοῦμενον ἐπαίροντα τὸ ὕδωρ aptis vd del ἔχειν 10ος allode δυναμένους
φθέγγεσθαι : Athen. 1. l. says ἔμπνευστὸν δ’ ἂν ἴσως ῥηθείη διὰ 111 ἐμπνεῖσθαι
τὰ ὄργανον 11πὸ τοῦ idaeos: 110 next goes on to describe how this is done.
Pliny however, 111 88, 11000 subremigo in its literal sense of rowing under-
neath: can then the words imply here ‘ he rows below upon the water’,
ie. while 110 10 playiug above with his 11011110, 110 ismoviug something
below with his 1001, which sets the water in 1110110111 209 justin the
same way the wind 01 101110 maddened at being dislodged bythe 10110010
01 water fights in 1110 straitened 100111,0111111111οΕ100 10010 mightily like
the 01101110 01 1110 Triton, or the waterorgan, both like it moved by
water. 0110110010 fureur: see n. 1067. 301 001 only 010 111010 these
external causes 01 wind 10 Ε100, 11111 we must believe they 010 produced
below the earth 110111 causes similar 10 those outside. 303 premunt
isclearly right, 0101110111 having no meaning 11010. proauum 111111· 10 10
the proper Latin construction 'in the sense 01 ‘mutuo premunt pre
muntur': 0110111456 ‘comprendunt inter se'3 1787 ‘ iuter 00 01111010,
where I give instances 110111 010010, Caesar 0011 Livy. 305 imaque
cet. must mean ‘ and do not settle down until they 010 10 0 sale plaoe’:
but perhaps J acob’s ‘tuta dum sede’ is necessary: with quein 01 uo 101
dum, comp. 206 quc 011110 β rightly, 07011110 α ο.

soc-³28: if even you contest what I say, you must allow that
¹ rocks tumble underground, and 00 001100 a dispersion of air, and produce
wind: also that tho moisture 01 mists produces air and wind as we sce
011 1000110110 near a river: much greater is 1110 power 01 water under
the earth, 001101 winda which by constraiut are rendered 10010 violent,
until they burst 0111 with their fires from tho crater 01 Etua. 307
