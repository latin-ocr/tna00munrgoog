Ἡδύλος lusia κ.τ.λ. α’ρχῆ δ’ οὖν τοῦ δυσμικοό παράπλου τό Kolpos τοῧ
pileorum πρός Ῥόδον, καὶ sidia ε’στιν ἄκρα ἀφ’ ἧς ῥίπτουσι roris αἶψαμίνονς
τοῦ βωμοῦ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος. This must havebeen the headland Φρούριον
mentioned by Ptolemy v 13 just before Κοόριον; and the whole of the

small peninsula of Κούριον must hare been assigned ιο the worship of
Apollo Hylates: Steph. Byz. Ἀμομαοσός· πόλις Κόπρου ἓν ᾖ τιμᾶται
’Υλόπης Ἀπόλλωνι Ἐρόσθεια· πόλις Κύπρου ἓν ᾗ Ἀπόλλων τιμᾶται ‘Yad-
της. Διονύσιος Βαοοαρικῶν τρίτῃ, Ol r' ἔχον Ὺλότοο θεοῦ ἕδος Ἀπόλ-

Κόπρου ἒν ᾗ τετίμηται Ὑλότρς Ἀπόλλων. The conspicuous position of
the peninsula· in question must have made this name os Apollo well-
known in Alexandriae and Roman times. The name recalls what Pau·
sanias 132 6 says, speaking of Magnesia upon Maeander or Lethaeus,
ἔστι δὲκαὶ τοῖς ἐπὶ ποταμῷ Ληθοόρ Μάγνησιν Ὗλαι κολοόμενον χωρίον·
ἐνταῦθα Ἀπόλλωνι όνεῖται σπήλαιον, μεγέθους μὲν ἕνεκα ori πολλοῦ θοό-
ματος, τό δὲ ἄγαλμα τοῦ ’Λπόλλωνος τό μόλιοτα όρχαῖοντ the similarity
of names and worship would seem to imply some connexion. In pre-
Alexandrine times Cyprus was more than halibarbarian: when it
became the chief possession of the ngptian crown, donbtless Apollo
Hylates, little known to old Graece, would be celebrated by other Alex·
andrina writers besides Lycophrom-writers now lost but accessible to
our author, who, as we shall often have occasion to see, was a man of
varied learning. ,

θ Ι now corne to the Dodmro of maa which cannot be right, as
Apollo had no business there. It once occurred ιο me that ὒονιίονιὰι,
iu the Roman sense, might be the right reading: the whole of that coast
teemed with his sanctuarios: comp. Strabo 618 παρὰ τόσον γόρ δή τὴν
παραλίαν ταότην ό· Ἀπόλλων ἔκτοτίμηται μέχρι Τενέδου, Σμινθτός ἢ Κυλ-
λαῖος καλούμενος ἢ Γρυνεύς ἤ τινα ἄλλην ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχωνε Statius Theb. 1
699 in the middle of a similar address, ‘Seu Troiam Thymbraeus habes’s
But the true reading I now feel sure is όαιίοιιιὲς ‘the daughter of
Ladon': perhaps our author after some poet of Antioch may have used
the form Ladona on the analogy of Hesiod's Ἀμφιτροόιη and simdar
female patronymies What has just been said of the poeta and writers
os Alexandria, applies mors strongly ιο those ef Antioch and Daphne ι
they have perished and deservedly so no doubt; yet there are many
testimonias to shew that for· six or seven centurias Daphne not only in
splendour arrd bennty, but in fame as well, had taken the place of
Delphi, as chief sanctuary of Apollo. Bur it is not in Euripides or
Pindar· that we read of this: wehave ιο go· ιο Philostratus, Galen, Liba-
nius‚ chrysostom, Soramen, Nonum, lustin, Servius and the like. The
origin os Apollo’a worship there is told by «lustin xv 41 ‘Seleucus
