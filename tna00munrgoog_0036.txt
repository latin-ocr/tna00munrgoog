did not understand it, until I had written down at length in what way
I proposed to explain it This 1 hope will be found to be not the least
useful portion 01 this small work.

Our poem is found in some only of the earlier editions of Virgil;
and these appear to have all essentially the same text, having been
printed no doubt one 1101111110 other. Ihave before me two editions 01
1475, Rubeus’ dated January 01 that year and Ienson's, both belonging
100111 Trinity library: their texts are throughout the semein all but
quite unimportant pointS, except that Ienson in 514 has, probably from
conjecture, the correct manuscript reading lento, while Rubeus and
Ι believe all other early editions have 110010. These then I have deemed
am ply sufficient to represent the whole class, since, as might he expected
in 10 corrupt a poem, they follow the text of a 1010 and very interpolated
manuscript. Our poem first appears in 1 greatly corrected form in the
Aldine edition 01 the catalecta and other minor poems dated December
1517. This and the second Aldine 01 March 15341 have had before me,
and have found them both most useful in determining the history of our
text: the secordis mostly a reprint 01 the first 3 but yet hasa good
many important variations from it and 111 not a few cases is the first 10
101 as Ι know to offer a correct text. Once I have found the right
reading first in Gryphius' edition of 1547, - But soon all other editions
were to be superseded by Scaliger’s Virgilii Appendix, printed at Lycus
in 1572 and published in that or the following year: of two copies
before me 0110, Duport's, from our Trinity library has on the title-page
1572, the 011101 1573, which appears 10 be the usual date. A second
edition was published at Leyden in 1595, with some changes and
additional remarks by Scaliger and the editor Lindenbrueh. Anything
coming from Scaliger must display learning, power and originality3 and

Ι I do not think that any work 01 his on the Latin pects has these

qualities in a higher degree than hia notes on the Aetna Its great
difficulty put him on his mettle; its poetry too had 101 him a singular
attraction: following the older Italian authorities, not the more cautious
Aldine editor, hc attributed it to Ovid's friend Cornelius Severus and
therefore to the age of Augustus or Tiberius: ‘quo neque post-tempora
Tiberii 01011111 cultius poema neque mendosius ullum ad nos peruenit '‚
110 says at the end of his notes. The latter clause is true enough 3 the
former he will find few 10 approve. As is often seen in wigorous haters,
his antipathy to Lucan made him contrast our poet favourably with
‘isti pingues Cordubenses poetae, Musarum tarpdpara'. He set himself
therefore earncstly at work to correct and explain our poem. Hawing
besides the printed editions only one late and interpolated manuscript,
he must often from the nature of the 0110 go wide astray. Yet in not
a few instanccs with the glance of genius he descries the truth through
