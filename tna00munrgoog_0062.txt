a v. is lost here, as 143 100100 00 imperfect sentence: this would perhaps
give the required sense: ‘tantum effluit intra [Flatibus assiduis aer:

yon do not 000 how ; from which you may infer 011 comes 001 01 the
unknown depths of earth. Pliny, Seneca and others' 01100 mention wind
coming out of hollows and caves in the earth, the great difference 01

158-187: these winde, and the lires and 01 1101 disturbances which
they occasion, have not their origin near the surface: they come from
below and ere the effecta of great pressure and resistance. Look at
'Etua and the wild confusion within 110 crater: this will give you the
clearest conception 01 tremendous movements. 158 follere inteili-
gihle only in βε here and down¹ to 177 he appears 10 speak 01 subterra-

canoes or the like: the hiatus, probably 01 more than one v., after 142
renders the whole passage obscure 158 summis 000010 must mean
