ie he did not require to be 1101101 011 by the feet oi the troadem, as
explained by Turnebus and others. He confounds by a metonymy

common in the poete the god, the wine and the wine itself 3 but ycu
will hardly find elsewhere so harsh an instance of ‘Bacchi nomine
abuti ’. 14 Prodeant felitis: before Jupiter put en end 10 this age,
‘Mellsque decussit foliis’, as Virgil geor. 1131 says 15 Sc 010101,

wine. tuan gratia aaa, ie. eierat: then the country hed charms for
her; and she had not yet become a town-haunting lady. He seems
again to refer te Virgil’s ‘Pallas quas condidit arces. Ipsa colat: nobis
placeant ante omnia siluae’: comp. too claudian in 11111313 ‘passim
Vina fluent oleique lscus'. 11 is perhaps possible 1ο defend 190101, ‘ set
in motiom' by such passages ss Aen 1x 812 ‘sudor liquitur et piceum...
flumen agit’3 Lucr. 11 67 6 ‘Scintillaeque agers'. However I have
changed but 1 single letter of the mss, whereas De Rooy, followed by
Haupt in his prognem of 1859 p. 7, reads ‘oliua, Securos omnes aleret
cum gratia nirie': ie. the berry, personified by Pallas, hung on the
¹ tree: an antiolimax surely ior the golden age;. as that is true ef the
poet’s aud our own iron age as well

Εἷς Φᾶσιν ἔνθα ναυσὶν ἔσχατος δρόμοςτ comp. Lucus 969 ‘siquis pro-
currat 11 oras Vltimus extremes’. Scaliger here is quite beside the
mark. 18 19 1 v. seems 1ο be lost here such as this ‘incensum aut
Sipylo bis sex ad busta niuali Inpositam’: Pergamenis neuter in 589
‘flebile metis Pergamon': again inpositam 1011 has here no meaning 3
and a disjunctive particle iswanted. Niobe I believe 10 be spoken of
in 18 3 though many other heroic dames have been suggested: comp.
Nemesian. cyneg. 15, who seems to be imitating our poem, ‘Nam quis
nou Nioben numeroso funere maestam Iam cecinit’: and Propert.

‘Thebanaque semina dentes’ t iu samiae = pro seminibus: a sense which a'a
semiue of mss. could not have. But perhaps J scob’s misprint ‘ Spartamne
in semine’‚ i. e. Spartorum in semine, may be what the poet wrote: the ex-
pression then being still nearer Ovid’s 21 22 allude to the very words
