figures, carrying each 011 their shoulders a draped figure, probably froin
some famous statues: Claudian has a poem to the picus brothers and
their statues. 625 Αυιμίιίοα of α and most mss. is curione. fhrtc's,

Delcst: this use of est = licet, is common in and after the Augustan age:
Hor. epistr 1 32 ‘Est quadam prodire tenus’ ,- andSat12101 ‘Oois tibi
paene uidere est Vt nudam’, with the dat. as here; for Ι join ‘illis
rapere est': this booty, if none else, they τααμ carry off. 634 μίσει

this v, like much in our poem is abrupt and obscure: he must mean,
that day, disastrous as it was', was rendered blessed by this deed of piety‚
the ground they trod -was unharmed‚ while all around was vested:
Conon narrat 43 gives a suu account, and as ho wrote in the time of
Augustae, itis very probable that our author had read the whole narra-
tive, of which we now have Photius’ abstract: I cite it, to illustrate our

, poem from 605 to the end: οἵ τε Αἴτνης τοῦ πυρός κρατῆρες ἅνέβλυσόν

locus nominaretur campus piornm’: so that doubtless there was α notion
that where their tonrh and statues were shewn, there the lire first
divided and let them pass unharmed: hence probably ‘innoxia terra’:
