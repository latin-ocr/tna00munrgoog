our poet follows a stoic: but in Manil. 163 wc should surely read ‘Et
saccata magis struxerunt aequora terram’: the sea in clearing itself
strained 011 its slime and sc helped tc build up the dry land: siccata 01
mss. and editions has nc sense: the best mss have 1101011011, not
caduceum 01 editions. 105 tortis in ι alone: neither Wernsdorf nor
Jacob adopting it, though Davies de nat. deor. p. 204 says ‘tortis νίνη.
ια. quemadmodum diserte representat msqui fuit in bibliotheca prae·
stantissima Ioannis Mori, nuper Eliensis episcopi’ ie our ο. These wss.
are unintelligible in all mss, bnt α, and editions have made matters
worse. 100 Exuit: Manil. 1 165 ‘orbisque per undas Exiliit’3 Lu-
cilius Iunior ap. Seu. nat. quaest 111 1 1 ‘Elisus Siculis de fontibus
exilit amnis’. 107 110 end 01 this ν. 1οο is onl'y in a: in other mss.
it is wanting, or asin all editions absurdly corrupted charybdis is
curicus: it may be added to the Greek words he uses in a Greek sense:
comp. Eur. suppl. 501 Οὐδ’ ἥρπασεν χάρυβδις οἰωνοσκόπον Τέθριππον ἅρμα
περιβαλοῦσα χάσματιτ Strabo p. 275 Ὀρόντὴς ἔν τῇ Συρίᾳ καταδὺς εἷς τὸ
petati χάσμα Ἀπαμείας καὶ Ἀντιοχείας, ὃ καλοῦσι χάρυβδιν auh·

110 1011 cr 1111 was not so formed at its birth, Nec ncta cet, hut
was hollowed out by subsequent, though ancient causes, by air within try·
iug to escape or the water eating cut a way. ccusc uetusto is either
the liter spiritate or the lynqrhc perennia 111 liber cet ε the air within
roving freely about, wherever it has space, in trying to escape gradually
forces a way lor itself. intra has the same adjectiva] force that retro in
140 has, and cetra in 457. 113 Edit is pers 01 e⁹dct for the position
01 que see n. to 7 9: Scaligcr’s lima for limo, adopted by many, seems
very unsuitable to ntollr't. 114 a 3rd possible cause: my ,11ιᾶαο for
nune, ‘have firsed', is surely better than ιιιόινι. 116 dcem...
causas seems to me nearer the mss. and to give a better sense than
άοοααάα...ιοιιοα, as opes causae appears scarcely latin: thereis a kind
’01 studied point in causo-cccmus, ‘there is no cause (i ο. need or occa·
sion) for explaining the causes, sc long as wc have the effect': this kind
cf point is common in our poet and in his age generally: comp. 122
‘trahat-contrahat’: and with οαιιοα docendi comp. (lic. dediu. 116 ‘ac
mihi quidem explicandae philosophiae caussam adtulit casrrs grauis ciui-
tatis’. 112 the end 01 this v. too is perfect only in s: Aldus
comes near to c: γδι omit the words altogether. 119 here too a v. is

· surely lost, such as ‘Rursus saepe solet uestaque uoragine condi': comp.
132 ‘praecipiti conduntur flumina terra': the sudden appearance cr
disappearance 01 rivers, even large ones,is more common in lands known -
to the poet than in curs: comp. Strabo quoted to 10⁷,- Sen nat quaest,
111 ’263 ‘quaedam flumina palam in aliquem specum decidunt etsie ex
oculis auferuntur’: and comp. what follows with what follows in our
poem. 120-122 are very corrupt in all but αι my alterations ³
