‘sicet Pithecussas [i. e Aenaria] in Campano sin'u ferunt ortas3 mox
in his montem Epopon, cum repente flamma ex eo emicuisset, eam·
pen-i aequatum planitie’: incidas means much the same as repente ol
Pliny. 430 Ifollow αι extincta depende on Dicitur. cuper,i.e.et
insuper testis est locus: for this district comp. Strabo p. 246 at be-
ginning, ύπέρκειται δὲ τῆς πόλεως εύθύς ἦ τοῦ Ἡφαίστου ἀγορά, πεδίον
περικεκλειμένον διαπύροις ὀφρύσι καμινιύδεις ἐχούσαις ἀναπνοὰς πολλαχοῦ

what precedes, and Petronius 120, v. 67 ‘Est locus exciso penitus de
mersus hiatu Parthenopen inter magnaeque Dicarchidos arna, cet.²
Petronius was probably contemporary with our author. 432 ut ubere,
tc express its great plenty: see the last words quoted from Strabo.
433 fecundius seems to agree with ubere, rather than scalpitur. 434
Insula cet. the third of hacc loca. Rotunda of mss. Ι keep, though
Scaliger and later editors read Rotundus: comp. Ovid met. 1 169 ‘Laetea
nomen habet'; xv740 ‘Insula nomen habet'; and still more like our
, passage, l..l 96 ‘aetas cui lecimus aurea nomen'y Sueten. v 24 at end,
‘Gabinio Secundo.. cognomen Cauchius usurpare concessit': Rotunda
is the Greek Στρογγύλης it and Hiera next mentioned arc both described
l as active volcanoes by Diodorus v 7
l 435 and 430 are both given rightly ογ calone. 430 Et tuph: a
l stone too helpe, well suited for kindliug fires, but yet without the proper-
tier of the true molonis of Etna: Diod. l. l. ἐκφυσᾶται δὲ καὶ ἄμμος καὶ
, λίθων διαπύρων πλῆθος. 430 Insula, the foruth of these places: it rs

l Scaliger, adopted by later editors, has no meaning, as he and ¹the rest
understand the sentence: they take incendi of 440 tc be a genitive
and join it with what follows: ‘the greater part of the conflagration-
has cooled down': what follows proves that Pura is pura banaa as
otherwise 440 and 441 have no sense: incerzda‘ is the influa ‘the
island, but a part of it only, still continues to burn: the greater
portion ete': dano could take an infin. ,in our author's age: Patron. 41
‘durani interrogare': Lucan 1v519 ‘ut uiuere durent’: the last syll.
cl adhuc might easily be absorbed in the foll. word 3 bnt perhaps adhuc
durat was what the poet wrote. 445 α alone preserves the end of
thiswn the fact of a connexion between the Lipari islands and Etna
seems to be still a moot point: see Daubenyp. 204. 440 elatumque:
comp. 385 and n there. 442 pasceret is clearly needed.
ets-509: but you may see for yourself that this lawa rs the chief
agent ιιι eruptione: look at its effect all round the mountain· it involves
all other materials' ιιι its own fieres conflagrationy it rs dangerous for
anyto approach the scene ol action ; some of the stones will burn away
toa clndor; but the great streames lawa advances, miles in breadth,
