any positive evidence in favour 01 his being the author os our poem, the
various points I have ffiscussed would to my mind rather increase than
diminish the probability. But there is no such evidence ; and though
Lucilius might seem to‘have asomewhat better claim than any other
single name, yet, as between him and the whole Roman world, the
chauces must be great against him ‘Aetna’ therefore still remains and
Ifancy ever will remsin the work ‘incerti auctoris'.

Our poem is on the whole singularly unattractive aud 01 meagre
merit enough: the poet seems to have been urged to his taslr not by the
muse, but by a most conscientious desire to enlightcn an ignorent world
on the true causes of the eruptions 01 Etua and the real nature 01 the
much misunderstcod lava-stone. More than hall the poem is taken up
with describing at most vexaticus length first the many ways in which
wind and air help to rouse the subterranean lires, and then the manner
in which the ‘lapis molaris’ is really lused The first 90 versos are
formal and have a strong twang 01 the school; the concluding episode os
the Gatanian brothers is stiff and constrained, and quite fails 01 the
pathos it is intended to produce. Perhaps the hest lines in the poem,
as Jacob has remarked, are rra-269, which touch on a theme suited
to the Roman tone ofthought3 and, for similar reasons, cos-598. As
I have already said, our Cambridge manuscript is my sole inducement
to publish this edition: it seemed tc me, considering ths good age 01 the
poem, worth while to give it to the world in an improved shepe. Its
attractione are too small to make me care to lreep it longer by me and
try to correct more completely its exceedingly corrupt text Ι give it
therefore to the world well aware how much has yet to be done; how
much, that appears to me satisfactory,¹ will be found defective by inelli-
gent readers As another edition 01 such a poem is not likely to- bs
called for, if on subsequent reflexion anything new might occur or
should critias publicly 01 privatsly suggest to me corrections] might
by and bye add these in the form osan appendix tc the present work. ·

One more point I have here to touch upon. As soon as Ι had be-
gun to revise the poem, I looked about for what might help my pur-
pose. Ascertaining that Professor¹ M. Haupt had written two programs
on the poem, Isought 01 course at once to obtain them. Ry an un-
luclry accident they were neither in my own library nor in any library
public or private„ so faras I could leam, in Cambridge, Oxford or Lon-
don. My bookscllers after some delay obtained for me the. second one
01 1859, from which I have got one brilliant emendation: the earlier

⁵ one 01 1854 was reported from Berlin and other places as wholly out 01
