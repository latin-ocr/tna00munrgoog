passed over this 10101010 pertinent source 01111001101100 and 0000011000.
Our 00010 1100 was written before 79, 0οᾶ as I cannot anyhow believe
it to be older than the silver age, its time would exaetly taHy with the
time 01 Lucilius. The poem too is evidently written by one who was
well acquainted with Etna and ita neighbourhood, and had saeuite
eruptione and their consequences: 0011 Lucilius was long governor 01
Sicily. I find too more 11100000 indication that the writer had a
practical knowledge 01 war and public business. More than once in the
commentaryI have noted how fond he 10 01 comparing the ravages 01
Etna with those 01 an enemy. The 10001 0011000 passage is 464-411,
which a first rendere intelligible: to 1110 0001, 0 spectator 01 the scene,
¹ Etna suggests the notion 01 0 victorious enemy attacking the terrified
bystandors at the same time with missiles and at close quartem The
picture looks as if drawn bya practised observer 01 battles, not by a
10010 0100010001. Now Lucilius would appear, as 110 said above, to have
served under Lentulus Gaetu-licus commender in Upper Germany, 01
that time 000 01 110 best schools 01 Roman war, where he might have
¹„ had many opportunities 01 seeing the 1011011000 falling under the swords
' and missiles 01 the legions and strewing the field 01 battle in the manner
here described The curicus metaphor too in 278 258 trasturas 100
as written by one who had 0100110οΙ 0100110000 010001 sconea The poet
1 00100101 speaks 10011 eyewitness of the neighbourhood 01 11001003 and
7 800000 talks to Lucilius 01 ‘Pompeios tuos', and ‘Parthenope tua’ as 11
Lucilius had 00010 close connexion with those 011110 All thie shows of
course only that 110 might have been, not that he was the author.
, Basidee the passage about Etna in Seneca’s 7 9111 0010110 which we

¹ Lucilius allego the 1001 as they say thet he was an epicurean and the
writer 01 the 00001 was an epicurean. This question they treat with
great carelessness and confusion 01 thought: Jacob 101010 10 001000

nay a 10110101 10 Zeno 01 Elea, 00 well aa a partisan 01 Zeno 01 Citium:
the other two passages directly disprove what he 0000110. Not to dwell
χ 00 011001 001010, there 010 three passages in the poem, each distinctly
