AETNA

Foua elaborate editions of this short poem have appeared at very
different periodo during the last three centurias, three of them extending
to bundrcds of pages each: the other, first alike in time and merit, ⁴
’ though of much less bulk than its successore, looks formidable enough
when compared with the text which it illustratas. A few months ago
nothing was farther from my thoughts than this poem: towards the
end of last October Ι had the pleasure of collating for Professor Ribbeck
amanuseript of the Culex in our public library3 audon finishing itI
¹ lookcd through the Aetna which came after3 and soon found on com·
paring it with Jacob's edition that it surpassed other collated manu-
* scripte in merit at least as much as in age; that it supplied several
entire verses wanting in them, and oftener still half lines or single

hopelessly corrupt. Stimulated by this I made a transcript at leieure
hours during November of the whole poem, copying the manuscript
pege by page Afterwards while absent from Cambridge in the month
¹ of J euuary I formed from this copy a provisional text, appending to it
a complete collation of this codex and adding from Jacob a digest
of the readings of his two manuscripts, the Helmstaedt and the
Breslau. At the same time I gave as minute an account as I could of
the variatione of the mysterious lost Florentine fragment bya careful
ζ examination of the two printed sources from which they are tc be
gotten, both of which I had and have before me. Having further
’ ascertained that the British Museum contained two· manuscripts of cur
poem I made an accurate collation of them? in the month of January.
From these sources are derived the various readings which appear below
κ my text. A fuller description of them shall be given after I have first
said a few words of the various editions which in forming my own I
have had the power or the will to consult The explanatory com-
mentury forms the largest part of my edition: something of the sort I
found to be necessary for my own satisfaction, much of the poem being ¹
so obscure aud so corrupt that often I could not tell whether I under·
stood what was before me, or, the next best thing, feel quite sure thatI
