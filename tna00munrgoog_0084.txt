Terence: it often denotes actual agency 3 but often too as here, merely ‚
means ‘I will warrant, engage, wager‘3 as‘Plaut cure. 586 ‘in tri·
tico facillime Vel quingentos curculiones pro uno faxo reperies'3 Men.
468 ‘Non esse eam dices faxo: its ignorabitur'3 pseud 49 ‘Recita
modo: ex tabellis iam saxo scies': or facim, as aulul. 490 ‘Ego faxim
muli, pretio qui superant equos, Sint uiliores Galliae cantheriis': faxo
continued ιο ιο used by the poets, Virgil, Ovid, Val. Flaccus, Silius,
Statius, generally with the sense of agency‚ but not always, asin Stat.
Theb. vm 78 ‘Faxo haud sit cunctis leuior metus atra mouere Tartara,
frondenti quam iungere Pelion Ossae'. 500 pedes is clearly to be
read: the pa was absorbed in persaepe and then des became deba which
has no sense at all: the lava has osten been observed to lie deeper even
than this.

,510-535ε do not be misled by false analogias ιο think that the
burris molaria is not one uniform substance: it is as much so as copper,
which you know to be copper aiter it is fused as well ss before: other
stenes may burn ; yet they never fuse like the acetaria-One is tempted
to think the main purpose of his poem was ιο eulighten the world on
the true nature of the lupia molmis, which sciolists had grossly misre-
preseuted. I have hardly changed a letter of e here: later mss and all
editions have rendered the passage unintelligible3 obscure it is at the
best. 512 the fluere of α alone gives light hero: in vain he tries, he
says, ιο explain his subject, if you believe the fable that it is a different
substance that is fused by the fire: then tbe furcillae cet is'not very
clear 3 but he seems to say that these people hold that the Flumina, or
lava-streame, then horden by having the property of fauilla: filumino
has reference ιο fraere 3 comp. too 497 Flumina cmwiatuat ripas: this
passage in later mss. and consequently in all editions has no meaning.
513 proprietate: comp. Pliny xm 121 ‘proprietatem habet fructum
amittendi lanugine’3 Son. epist. 84 4 ‘an quae collegerunt, in hunc
saporem mixtura quadam et proprietate spiritus sui mutent’: ib. 118
13-17 the word occurs six times. stoebe nel si: or if they falsely
think that it is sulphur· mixed with bitumen that burne in the molaris:
above he has shown that these substances and alumen do burn in other
volcanoes ; but the molaris is independent of them and indeed sermore
powerful 515 these people attempt to sbew this by such a fact as
the followingz after potter’s clay they say is burned in the furnace its
substance is fused 3 and the potters give proof of this fact 3 and then by
cold it again hardens. 510 figuli sunt fides huic: comp. 504 ‘plagis
-fides' ; and 177. 518 but such a mark common to different things
is too slight to build upon 519 trepidat ‘wavers and is uncertain':
opposed to certo oerum oet 520 the poet's own proof: the molcaa'ais
of a uniform nature like copper which is the same aiter as before fusion.
