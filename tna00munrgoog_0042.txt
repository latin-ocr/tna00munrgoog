then 0000 000 first 137 vss. of the poem filled also three leaves ; and

this might 00 employed as a further argument that several vss have

A few worda have now to be said of the reputed authors 01 our

to whom it is assigned by our best mss. 0 γ e: thas simply ‘de etna

culex or ciris to be his work, I need not controvert what none will
now maintain. The name of Cornelius Severus 000 found more ac-
