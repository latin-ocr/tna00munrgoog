and the Illyrisn passes; the tyranny of Gaius had not been able
to force him to abendon Gaetulicus, nor the freedmen of Claudius
mode him unfeithiirl to other friends. Seneca whose letters appear to
have been written in old age, calls him a ‘iuuenis’ in contrsst with him-
self. But as he must have arrived at years of discreticn in 39, when
Gaetulicus perished, he must have passed the ege of forty some years
before Senece‘s death Seneca speaks of his philosophicul testes, and
these are sufficiently proved by the whole tenour of·their correspondence
He also calls him ‘my poet' end cites several of his verses3 and in the
teth letter, of which we have already spoken, he alludes to Lucilius'
design of describing Etna in his poem, a trite topic with poets, as Ovid
had done after Virgil, Severus after Ovid: ‘aut ego te non noui aut
Aetna tibi saliuam mouet: iem cupis grande aliquid et par prioribus
scribere'. This passage implies that Etna was to form an episode in
some poem, as it had done in the Aeneid, the metamorphoses and the
work of Cornelius Severus, and would seem at first sight to oppose the ·
claime of Lucilius ae much se those of Severus. But there is this
difference: the poem of Sevems was already written, that of Lucilius
was not ; and ae his materiale and interest in the subject increased, he
moy have chosen to write an independent work on Etna Would then
the ege of our poem agree with that of Luciliusl euactly, Ithink: for I
have uo doubt it belongs to the eilver age. When it is freed from the
barberous rhythms introduced into it by Scaliger, Gorallus, Wemsdorf
and Jacob, its techniosl style is exactly that of Lucan and other poeta
who formed themselves cn the model of Ovid3 and I cannot but think
it was written before Vel. Flaccus, Statius and Silius had set the fsshion
ofslavishly copying Virgil's thoughts and lsngnnge: empnam, small as
its virtues are, is independcnt enough on the whole in its matter and
manner. That Lucffius was fond of Ovid would appear from Seneca
net quaest 1v2 2 ‘ quere non cum poete meo iocor et illi Ouidium suum
impingo'. It contains however I think still more positive evidence of
its age: Wernsdorf hos noted thet the artificial Triton mentioned in
293 seems to allude to e mechanical contrivence of the age of Slaudius3
and he and Jacob allege this as a certain proof that the poem was not
written before this time. Very likely the poet may allude to this very
¹ machine 3 but this is by no means certain, 'as Ι have shewn in my notes
to the passage that similar Tritone, as well as weterergens, are described
by Heron of Alexandria long before Again the writer, anxious to
illustrate his subject in every way, carefully describoe all the extinct or

nearly extinct volcanoes he knows, those of the Aeolion ulands, Ischia,
and the region between Naples and (lumea which he had himself in-
spected. If then the ‘Vesaeui Hesperiae letalis apex’ had, when he

wrote, already burst on the astonished world, he could not possibly have
