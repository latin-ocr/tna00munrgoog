enumerated in the new catalogue, vol.111p.703—-706: I give here some
detrih not mentioned there.

The volume we now have is but half the original manuscript: it
commences with quaternion 1x: the quaternione are all marked attho
bottomof the last page of each, 1x x x1 x11x111: then follow 7 leaves of
the next one: the last leaf has its lower half cut off: it contained no
doubt the portrait ol the scairroa eur summm, which has been pilfered by
some nnscrupulous collector. Our poem occupies 33 peges, viz. the last
two leaves of quaternicn ΧΠ, the whole of 1111, the next six leaves, and*
the first page os the last imperfect leaf: page one contains the heading
ol the poem and 19 verses, the next 31 contain 20 verses each, the last
page has 6 verses cf the poem and the subscription. The lines in this
edition are numbered in the order they come in a which has 645 verses:
the two additional ones in β are reckcned as supernumeraries a came

lection in 1715 3 and is the codex· Eliensis cited by Davies in his (licere ·
denatura: it cannot be later than the lOth century 3 and appears to
have been written in England‚ as some of the modern poems in it are

¹ concerned with the literary squabbles of this country. Indeed Mr

Bradshaw our librarian thinks it possible that in piece 7 ‘versus L de

¹ quodam superbo’, the L is Lantfredus or lanfridus, a disciple of Bishop

Ethelwold of winchester, at that time the chief seat of English learning.
If this be so, our ms. cannot be saner than the end of the lOth century:
to me it appears tc be earlier. Itis beautifully and for the age accu-

¹rutely written 3 the words are correctly divided, except that, in con-

, formity with the ancient pronunciation, the atonics, such as et, qai, nou,
¹ and the monosyllabis prepositions are often united with the word that

follows: odora ut for odor cat, opero meditus for operae nedibus, aper

, etuentoe for ageret uentos, iactuum olidum for turbari edestam stand quite

by themselves. There are few contractione, except those which are
common in the oldest and best codices: thus we often, but by no means
always, meet with the usual abbreviatione asper, pro, prae, que, eet,
qaod, ofthefinal m, and nemin the middle of words, of tar in the pre-

, sent passive, and -buc iu the dat. or ahl. plur. Single errare instanoes ol

whole very good aud I have followed it in all but palpable corruptions:
even nour and salpiam· I have retained as they may be from the
author: barbarisms like Aeeta, emera, amcam, inficior are very rare:
miliia is spelt rightly: millio once where the reading is otherwise cor-
rupt: ae is generally correotly given, preceps and the like being the

l exceptione. With good reason then, as already observed, Ihave noted
